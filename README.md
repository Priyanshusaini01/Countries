Project Title: Country Information  using REST API

Description:
A web application that fetches and displays information about 250 countries using data from the RestCountries API. The application allows users to search for countries, filter by regions, and toggle between light and dark modes. Each country card provides details such as the flag, name, population, region, and capital city.

Skills and Technologies:
 
Fetch API: For making asynchronous API requests to fetch country data from the RESTCountries API.
REST API Integration: Consuming the REST API to retrieve real-time information about countries.
HTML5: Structuring the web page content and presenting country cards with proper semantic elements.
CSS3: Styling the application, including the use of Flexbox for responsive layout and grid-based card design.
Flexbox Layout: For aligning and organizing country cards in a responsive grid.
Responsive Web Design: Ensures that the layout adjusts to various screen sizes and devices.
Dark Mode Toggle: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes using CSS and JavaScript.
Search Functionality: Enables users to search for specific countries by name.
Region Filter: Allows users to filter countries by geographic region.
JavaScript DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creating and updating the content on the page (country cards, population, region, capital).
Error Handling: Graceful handling of cases when some data is missing or API calls fail (e.g., some countries lacking a common name).
Array Methods: Use of methods like .map(), .filter(), and .forEach() to manipulate the country data efficiently.
Logical Properties: Use of margin-inline, padding-inline, etc., for handling internationalization (support for both LTR and RTL languages).
FontAwesome: For icons used in the dark mode toggle (if applicable).
Additional Features:
Search Bar: Typeahead search functionality to quickly find countries.
Filter by Region: Dropdown menu to filter countries based on their geographical region.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Interactive Cards: Displaying dynamic country data with population, region, capital, and more.
Flag Display: Shows the country's flag along with other details.
